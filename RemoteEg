Add the remote and name it origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/monicag-gupta/gitAristrocat.git
Now origin is created as the name for your remote repository.
Verify it
git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/monicag-gupta/gitAristrocat.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/monicag-gupta/gitAristrocat.git (push)
If origin already exists and you want to change it
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/newrepo.git
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/monicag-gupta/NewRepoAris.git
If you need to remove and re-add
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin <new-url>
