Add the remote and name it origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/monicag-gupta/Prj1.git
Now origin is created as the name for your remote repository.
Verify it
git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/monicag-gupta/gitAristrocat.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/monicag-gupta/gitAristrocat.git (push)
If origin already exists and you want to change it
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/newrepo.git
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/monicag-gupta/NewRepoAris.git
If you need to remove and re-add
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin <new-url>


Basic git pull Command
git pull
Fetches from the default remote (origin) and merges the current branch with the fetched changes.
With Rebase Example
git pull --rebase origin main
Good for keeping a cleaner commit history (linear).
With Fast-Forward Only
git pull --ff-only
Safer for CI/CD environments â€” avoids unintended merge commits.
Verbose Output
git pull --verbose
Useful for debugging fetch/merge steps.
Pull Unrelated Repos
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
Used when combining projects from different sources.
