Creating a GitHub Project:

From a Repository:
Go to the repo → Click on the Projects tab.
Click New project.
Choose Project (Beta) or classic (Beta is more flexible).
Select a template: Board, Table, or Timeline.
From Organization:
Go to your GitHub Organization page.
Click Projects → New project.


Ways to Add:
Directly from an Issue: Open an issue → Right sidebar → “Projects” → Select a project
From within the Project: Click “+ Add item” → Search or paste issue link
Automation: Add items via rules (e.g., “If label bug is added → move to project”)



GitHub Issues are:
Bug reports
Feature requests
Tasks or user stories
Each issue can include:
Title
Description
Assignees
Labels
Milestones
Linked Pull Requests
Projects lets you visualize the status and progress of issues in one place.



You can add automation rules like:
Move issue to “In Progress” when assigned
Move issue to “Done” when PR is merged
Set status when label is added
Example:
Trigger: New Issue Created
Action: Add to Project → Status: Backlog
